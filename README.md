# Random Identity Generator

### Abstract:
Welcome to the Random Identity Generator! Got into a little trouble lately and need a quick name change? Well, my application is the one for you! We are very secure so no log in needed. You also can see your information on refresh but if you need a quick exit, closing the browser will erase your saved information.You can generate a new identity by clicking on the 'New Identity' button on the home page. This generates some new identity information that you have the option to save. To view your saved identities, click the 'Saved Identities' section to generate the list. If you change your mind about one of them, you have the option to delete. Try and stay out of trouble - but if needed, *Random Identity Generator* is here to help!
